<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h2>Race rules:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> There will be two races a week, on Wednesday and Saturday
    during "the season" which runs from the start of October to the
    end of April.<br><br>
  <li> Each race will be repeated three times (to cater for different
    timezones). Once the route has been published (typically a week in
    advance) you can sign up for one (or more!) of these
    on <a href="https://my.rouvy.com/onlinerace">Rouvy</a> as usual. 
    Direct links to the races are also provided directly from
    <a href="bla.html">our race page</a> which lists dates, times,
    routes, etc. <br><br>
  <li> If none of the official times suit you, you can also arrange
    your own race. The race must be on
    the same day (in GMT) as the official races. This gives everybody
    24 hours to do the route. Make sure you
    <a href="bla.html">register your race here</a> so our machinery can extract
    the finish time and insert it into the compound ranking. The
    registration page will check that the race is held on the right
    course and on the right day.<br><br>
  <li> You cannot get credit for individual rides (i.e. rides done outside
    races). This is mainly a technical issue: Rouvy doesn't provide
    access to the finish times for individual rides and I don't have
    time to maintain this data by hand. If you absolutely want to ride
    by yourself, make your own race (see above) and password protect it; keep
    the password to yourself and nobody will bother you.<br><br>
  <li> If you participate in multiple instances of a race, your best
    time will count.<br><br>
  <li> Points will be awarded according to the UCI cyclocross scheme:
    40 points for the winner; 30 for second; 25 for third; 20 for
    fourth; 19 for fifth; then decreasing by one for each subsequent
    position (but kindly stopping at zero!).<br><br>
</ul>

<h2>Other rules: Behave yourselves!</h2>
There shouldn't be any need for rules. We're all here to have fun
racing and that's that.
<br><br>
Sadly, past experience shows that there are certain issues that
raise tempers, so to avoid endless (and pointless) discussions, here
are a few rules anyway.
<ol>
  <li> Don't be an idiot. <br><br>
  <li> All races must be for "smart trainers only". Rouvy is the sole judge
  of which trainers fall into that category. <br><br>
  <li> Calibrate your trainer when needed. Most modern trainers don't
    seem to require this any more anyway but if yours does, do it!
    Note that it may even make you faster... (I calibrate my Direto X every once
    in a while and have also done it for the Direto I
    had before, but it's never made any appreciable difference).   <br><br>
  <li> You may have noticed that Rouvy allows you to specify your
    weight. For the implications of this fact you are referred to rule 1.<br><br>
  <li> Banter on the <a href="bla.html">discussion board</a>
    is actively encouraged. Taking
    yourself (or this whole thing) too seriously is not. Launching
    debates about possible cheaters (or other rule 1 violators) is
    strictly <em>verboten</em>. If you have any
    concerns, please contact the race organiser directly and offline, so they
    can have a quiet word (and/or escalate things if necessary; see
    below).<br><br>
  <li> No overtly political etc. discussions because it's likely to create
    tension. This is not censorship - there are plenty of other forums
    on the internet where you can raise your views on such matters and
    get into lovely slanging matches with people you disagree
    with. But not here, please.  <br><br>
  <li> Regular rule breakers will be dealt with. Somehow. Haven't
    decided yet, but punishment could range from flogging (for minor
    offences) to ejection from the group (for major ones). I suggest
    we don't go there.<br><br>
  <li> And now go racing! Hard!<br><br>
</ol>
