        If you convert the file names of your .html pages to .php
        - then at the top of each of your .php pages you can use
        one line of code to include the content from your
        header.php

        <?php include('header.php'); ?>

        Do the same in the footer of each page to include the
        content from your footer.php file

        <?php include('footer.php'); ?>

        No JavaScript / Jquery or additional included files
        required.
