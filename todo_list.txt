- Don't download race data repeatedly but say that wget has been skipped and explain how to force new upload (delete/move file; specify name)

- check dns/dnf

- test option to provide best time from multiple races

- Put race rankings into separate data file, then write extra script
  to generate overall rankings from them
  
- read in race numbers (for rouvy url).

   Logic:

     create master file for upcoming official races. If that exists, read it
     and display on webpage (with link to race webpages)

     for races for which official races exist, offer specification
     of additional user generated ones. Display generated webpage link
     and ask for confirmation.


- rankings get re-generated from scratch every time a new race is done (so we can process new users; they get dns for races before they joined the group), but html pages get backed up before overwriting them.


- Master file for each race contains multiplier.
